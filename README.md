	These tests were developed using Selenium, Java and Webdriver. You can test each feature on its own using the individual test case, or you can run the entire test suite. In either case, the number of test cases is shown in the console as well as the number of tests that succeeded and the number of tests that failed. The program also outputs which tests have passed and which other tests have failed.
